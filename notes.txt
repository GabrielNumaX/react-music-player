regarding state.trackList

The better way to do this would be, you store the information of current playing song inside a state variable say 'currentSongInfo' which contains the same object of each song which we are getting inside the API call response

then you can directly use the album cover like this
this.state.currentSongInfo.albumCover

*******************************

Yes, you can create a new variable of currentSongInfo in the state, and one more to store the current song position.
So when someone clicks on the playlist card, you can get the id and using this id you can set the current song info in that state variable.

Just like we did in the Video Watch Page Project which we covered in the live session

********************************

Exactly, this way it will be more convenient as we are having two more functionalities which are (a) shuffling the playlist songs (b) continue playing the same song
